Welcome to isaikootu!

This is __very early not even alpha__ python app, which can: 
 1. index any directory for music files.
 2. search the index.

Basic Usage:
   To index:      

     $isaikootu index /home/tamizhgeek/Music

   To search:

     $isaikootu search album 'Mariyaan' 


To install just extract this dir and type, 'python setup.py install'

To run the tests type, 'python setup.py tests'

The index uses SQLite database and it is located under .isaikootu dir inside your home dir.

Thanks!
